# PlayJam
Spotify -a digital music service that gives you access to millions of songsüòç. Ever wondered of managing your playlists in an organized but easy way?ü§î Well, here's us!ü§ì

Many a times, we've some songs in our mind but at the time of playing the same when it's already deleted but slashes your mind to remind it againüòî. So, to not make it happen ever, you'll say this chat-bot to add your songs to your preferred playlist for later useüéâ

**PlayJam**, a Whatsapp chat-bot which asks your preferred song and directly adds it to your preferred playlist. As simple as it sounds!

## What requires this project to run locally?
1. Python - The programming language used by Flask.
2. Virtualenv - A tool for creating isolated Python environments.
3. Spotify Web API & Spotipy (Spotify python helper library)
4. Twilio Python helper libraries.

## Getting Started

**Step 1. Clone the code into a fresh folder**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/parthpandyappp/PlayJam
$ cd Playjam
```

**Step 2. Create a Virtual Environment and install Dependencies.**

Create a new Virtual Environment for the project and activate it. If you don't have the `virtualenv` command yet, you can find installation [instructions here](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Learn more about [Virtual Environments](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#virtual-environments).

```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source <path>/venv/bin/activate
```

Next, we need to install the project dependencies, which are listed in `requirements.txt`.

```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Step 3: Update environment variables and run the Server.**

Create a new file named `.env`and update it with the following Spotify credentials
```
# .env file
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_USERNAME="<SPOTIPY_CLIENT_USERNAME>"
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID="<SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID>"
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET="<SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET>"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SCOPE="playlist-modify-private"
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback"
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_URI="SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_URI"
SPOTIFY_MARKET="IN"

FLASK_APP_SECRET="<FLASK_APP_SECRET>"
```

If you don't prefer having a `.env` file, you can export each credential one by one using below:

```
(venv) $ export CREDENTAIL_NAME = <CREDENTIAL_VALUE>
```

Now we're ready to start our server which is as simple as:

```
(venv) $ python twilio_jukebox.py
```
Our sever doesn't have any interface as it's main job is to serve the main application script. So, let's just run this flask application besides which we'll be using `Ngrok` to connect the Flask application running on our system to a public URL that Twilio can connect to. Run the below command :

```
(venv) $ ngrok http 5000
```
Now, head over to `http://127.0.0.1:4040` where you'll get a unique URL for instance : `http://f35ec255a435.ngrok.io/`. Copy this and paste it at [Twilio Console]
(https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/whatsapp/sandbox?) where you've to configure your Whatsapp according to the instructions given there.

Now that our flask app on the server is running and also our Ngrok. All set! Open up your Whatsapp and get started!
